GrandOrgue allows the user to load and play virtual pipe organs.
Using sample sets, GrandOrgue is able to combine the individual pipe
sounds and organ behaviours to simulate a variety of pipe organs.

GrandOrgue is capable of loading and faithfully reproducing a variety
of sample sets. Through extensive testing, it appears highly
compatible with definition files that have worked in Hauptwerk&#x2122;
version 1. Other types of sample sets may also be compatible, and
other formats may soon be available. As such, you won't be able to do
anything at all with GrandOrgue without at least one sample
set. Sample sets generally come packaged or with installers. By
default, the software loads organs from "My Organs" in your documents
folder, but you may store sample sets wherever is convenient and space
permits.

      <indexterm>
        <primary>Volume Control</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
The volume control sets the volume control <emphasis>as a
percentage</emphasis> of full volume. Note that this is percentage of
voltage, and therefore every half corresponds to -6dB. That is, 50% is
-6dB, 25% is -12dB, etc. To the right of the spinner are the left and
right audio monitors, respectively. The clip indicator at the far
right will turn red if clipping occurs, and will stay red until the
volume is adjusted.

      <indexterm>
        <primary>Polyphony Control</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
The polyphony control sets the maximum polyphony before GrandOrgue
will refuse to play any additional samples. To oversimplify, polyphony
is the number of pipes that may sound simultaneously; but polyphony
may also be consumed when a key is released. It is recommended to
experiment with this setting initially, but leave it once you find an
acceptable setting. Your setting should balance between too little
polyphony (where you might not be able to play many notes on large
sample sets) and too much polyphony (where the CPU will overload and
artifacts will appear in the sound). Note that "wet" sample sets
(those with considerable reverberation) will consume polyphony many
seconds after the note is actually released. The default setting of
1024 should provide a reasonable starting point on a 1GHz CPU. To the
right of the spinner is the polyphony monitor. The clip indicator at
the far right will turn red if the polyphony limit has been reached,
and will stay red until the polyphony is adjusted.

      </indexterm>
      <para>
The spinner sets the current program number. This might be termed a
"sequencer" on modern computerized organs. It is possible to store up
to 512 organ states and access them sequentially via the predefined
MIDI events, or access any setting directly through the spinner. You
may also use the left and right keys on the keyboard to scroll through
the programs, and down to reactivate the current program (if you have
changed the stops since last activating it, for example). Note also
that when memory set is engaged, the target program wil be stored to,
i.e. if you push Shift + Right then the program would be advanced and
the current settings would be saved to this same next program.

      <para>
Each manual as well as the pedalboard is displayed in the center of
the screen. The keys are outlined when messages are received, but may
not be engaged by clicking the mouse. Right clicking on a manual will
open its corresponding MIDI Event Editor.

      <indexterm>
        <primary>Expression Pedals</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
Directly above the pedalboard are displayed the pedals, sometimes
referred to as "swell pedals", although they may control any of the
manuals (Great, Swell, Wonderful, etc). On a pipe organ, swell
shutters dampen the sound, and this is simulated in GrandOrgue by
adjusting the volume of the enclosed pipes. While the mouse is over a
pedal, you may use the mouse wheel to adjust its position, or right
click to open its corresponding MIDI Event Editor.

      </indexterm>
      <para>
The drawstops engage or disengage various components of the organ when
clicked - generally new ranks of pipes which are applied to each
manual. Other drawstops may perform actions such as coupling one
manual to another. This deals with the functionality of pipe organs
and is beyond the scope of this documentation. Right clicking on a
drawstop will open its corresponding MIDI Event Editor. Any changes
made there may be saved in the organ definition file or settings
files.

      <para>
Pistons generally perform an action when clicked and do not have an
on/off toggle, although some pistons may toggle in this way. Pistons
often recall drawstop combinations, and when used in combination with
the Memory Set, you can store your own combinations in the
pistons. Right clicking on a piston will open its corresponding MIDI
Event Editor. Any changes made there may be saved in the organ
definition file or settings files.

display indicating estimated time remaining and other indicators. If
you open a new sample set which shares samples with the previously
loaded sample set, those files are cached and will not be reloaded
from disk.

        <primary>Update Cache</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
Save the loaded and processed samples to the hard disk. Doing so
decreases loading time at the expense of hard disk space. Selecting
this option displays a message indicating how much space is required
and confirming that you would like to proceed. If compression is
disabled, load speed only increases by 10 to 15%. However, with
compression enabled, the load time when using the sample cache may be
cut by 40% or more.
      </para>
      <para>
Note that different load settings or tunings each require their own
cache file. For example, stereo compressed samples and mono
uncompressed samples each need their own cache. It is therefore
recommended that you limit your cache updates to one particular load
type (preferably stereo compressed, as this is the recommended
setting).

Enters memory set mode until the Memory Set menu option or toolbar
button is selected again. While the memory set is engaged, whenever
you push a divisional or general piston or activate a program change,
the organ will store the current settings to that piston or program
change rather than recalling them. For example, engaging a divisional
piston 1 during memory set will store the state of stops for that
manual into piston 1, which could then be pushed later (after memory
set has been disengaged) to recall those stops. A checkmark appears
next to the menu item, and the toolbar button remains pushed, to
indicate when memory set is active.

The effect of the panic button is to reset the sound, stopping all
sound and turning off all notes. It may also be quickly accessed on
the toolbar or via the Escape key. This should be generally
unnecessary, although it may be useful if you need to quickly stop the
sound output, or if the sound is breaking up due to CPU overload.

the MIDI event it is currently tied to; the "Channel" column indicates
which channel the action will listen on, if any; the "Data" column
indicates the specific data which will trigger the action - for
example, a controller number or a program change number. These actions
may be modified by selecting the action and clicking "Properties", or
by double-clicking on the action.

This displays the MIDI event editor dialog. You may select an event
from the drop-down box (only available events will be shown), or you
may select "(none)" to disable the action. The channel spinner sets
the channel tied ot the MIDI message, and the data spinner (when
applicable) selects the data tied to the MIDI message. For easy
configuration, click "Listen for Event" and then perform the desired
MIDI action (i.e. push a note on the appropriate keyboard, do a
program change, flip a MIDI switch, etc). If the performed MIDI event
is allowed for this action, its data is filled in and the "Listen for
Event" button is deactivated. You may also manually deactivate the
listener by clicking on it again. Be sure to select OK to save your
changes when you're done.

Either select a device and click Advanced, or double click on the
device. This brings up a window that allows the setting of a channel
offset. A channel offset allows the use of two MIDI interfaces with
conflicting MIDI channels. For example, applying a channel offset of 8
to one of the MIDI interfaces would cause that interface's channel 1
to appear as channel 9, channel 2 to appear as channel 10, and so
on. This may be useful if you have multiple keyboards that are
configured to use the same channel.

If set to Mono, all samples are loaded in Mono. When compression is
disabled, this will save 50%, but when compression is enabled, much
less will be saved because the compression is much less effective on
monoaural inputs.

When polyphony reaches 3/4 of the current maximum value, release
samples (reverberation tails) are faded out in order to conserve
polyphony.

When a note is released, phase cancellation may occur as the release
sample cross fades in. Selecting this option will make a best effort
to phase align the release sample to help minimize this effect.

When a note is released, the tremulants or swell pedals would not
normally affect the reverberation, and therefore it is highly
recommended to leave this option engaged.

For those sample sets with long reverberation tails ("wet"), enabling
this option will fade out the release sample if the note is played
staccato. It will have little to no effect on "dry" sample sets.
